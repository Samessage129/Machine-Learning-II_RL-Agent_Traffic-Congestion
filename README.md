Introduction
•	Objective: To optimize traffic flow in urban environments using Reinforcement Learning.
•	Motivation: Traffic congestion leads to economic losses, environmental pollution, and commuter dissatisfaction. Intelligent traffic management systems can alleviate these issues.
•	Dataset: Traffic data from the Open Data Portal of Austin, Texas, containing real-time vehicle counts and signal timings.
Methodology
•	Data Preprocessing:
o	Handled missing values and outliers.
o	Normalized and scaled features for RL model compatibility.
o	Feature engineering to include parameters such as traffic density, signal duration, and queue lengths.
o	Geospatial Analysis of the location of traffic detectors based on coordinates
•	Model Selection: (RL agent)
o	Implemented Q-learning with a discrete state-action space.
o	Reward function designed to minimize vehicle wait time and maximize traffic throughput.
•	Simulation Environment:
o	Used a Python-based simulation to emulate traffic scenarios.
o	Integrated OpenAI Gym for RL experimentation and model evaluation.
Results
•	Performance Metrics:
o	Accuracy Score of Detector Status Prediction: 0.6718555417185554
o	Optimal Coordinates to Address Traffic Intensity: [ 30.29880327 -97.73785624]
o	Sample test after creating environment 
	Initial Observation: [ 30.2672 -97.7431   1.    ]
	After Action Observation: [ 30.2682 -97.7431   0.2   ]
	Reward: -0.2
o	RL agent testing results: Total Reward Achieved: 0.0
•	Visualization:
o	Graphical representation of traffic flow improvements and RL model performance over training epochs.
